# Twitch Extension for Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links! Streamers

A twitch extension that shows as a toggable menu details for the cards used in the streamers deck inside the twitch player.

While the extension already works, this is **not** a finished project. See "Future improvements" below to see what's up next.

## Future improvements

- Make the deck register simpler. The ideia will be that with a screenshot from the deck editor (from inside the game), using image recognition, the extension will discover which cards are in the deck without the need for the streamer to add them manually.

- Improve overall look of the extension

- Include Skill and Skill hover info in the viewer page
